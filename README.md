# Kovan Faucet

The Kovan network is secured by preventing malicious actors from obtaining large amounts of Ether, but legitimate developers need to be able to receive Ether to deploy and test contracts.

## Icarus Faucet

Pairty Technologies have set up a faucet service that requires your account to be registered via SMS using Parity. Any registered address can then receive 5 Kovan Ether ever 24.

First you must verify an account on the mainnet using pairty's SMS verification service. A video walkthrough is available at: https://youtu.be/99UucFzYCRc. We recommend you register using a fresh account with a small amount of Ether (as it will used as the recieving address on Kovan).

Once you have registered your account, you can then simply visit http://icarus.parity.io/[your-verified-address] every 24 hours to receive your allowance (which will be sent to that account on the Kovan testnet).

## Gitter Channel (Manual Github Verification)

If you have any issues, feel free to request to receive Kovan Ether using the gitter channel:
