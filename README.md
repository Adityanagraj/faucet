## Icarus Faucet

Pairty Technologies have set up a faucet service that requires your account to be registered via SMS using Parity. Any registered address can then receive 5 Kovan Ether ever 24.

First you must verify an account on the mainnet using pairty's SMS verification service. A video walkthrough is available at: https://youtu.be/99UucFzYCRc

Once you have registered your account, you can then simply visit http://icarus.parity.io/[your-verified-address] every 24 hours to receive your allowance (which will be sent to that account on the Kovan testnet).
