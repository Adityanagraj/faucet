## Requesting large amounts of KEth

The above faucets allow to get 1-3 KEth.

Many transaction can be made with small amounts of KEther. For a typical contract transaction requiring 100k gas at a price of 20 Gwei, you can make: `1e18 / (100000 * 20e9) = 500` transactions with just 1 KEth. If you need a large amount of Kovan Ether please open an issue in this repo explaining the reasons for you to request more. Exception will be handled on a case by case basis.
